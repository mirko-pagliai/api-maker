/**
 * Parses the request URL into controller, action, and parameters. Uses the connected routes
 * to match the incoming URL string to parameters that will allow the request to be dispatched. Also
 * handles converting parameter lists into URL strings, using the connected routes. Routing allows you to decouple
 * the way the world interacts with your application (URLs) and the implementation (controllers and actions).
 *
 * ### Connecting routes
 *
 * Connecting routes is done using Router::connect(). When parsing incoming requests or reverse matching
 * parameters, routes are enumerated in the order they were connected. For more information on routes and
 * how to connect them see Router::connect().
